##Blebox shutterbox

Tool for managing external shutters with shutterbox. It adds the ability to tilt the shutters. This functionality in theory is implemented in shutterbox (if you select appropriate mode for shutters), but I don't like the way it works. This tool can be used for example with homeassistant to trigger shutter opening, closing and tilting.
